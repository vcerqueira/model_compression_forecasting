# Model Compression for Forecasting

This repo is the supplementary material for the paper entitled "Model Compression for Forecasting".

The files should be ran in the following order:


## 1-get-predictions.r 

This files gets the predictions from the forecasting models in each iteration of the repeated holdout procedure

## 2-combine-predictions.r

The predictions obtained in the previous point are combined using different dynamic approaches; these ensembles are also compressed into individual models

## 3-analysis.r

Analysis of the results obtained
